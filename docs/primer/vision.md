# Vision

To have a global collective of developers participating, including everyone from day one novices to developers with decades in the field.  
  
To have a range of multiple projects in process at any given time.  Projects can include firmware and software, from [user interface (UI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) to [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) and [infrastructure as code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code).  If it can be coded, it can be mobbed.
  
To have small developer mobs working on any given project at any given time. (e.g. [Global Liquid Mob](https://global-liquid-mob.github.io/))
