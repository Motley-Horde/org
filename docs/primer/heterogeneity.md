# Heterogeneity:<br/>Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging (DEIB)  

To the extent possible anyone and everyone should be able to participate.


## Language  

At present, all code and documentation should be in English.  This is to ensure that code can be worked on by the most [^language-by-speakers] people and it is the standard within the largest openly available body of source code [^github-translation-examples].  To prevent documentation translations from becoming out-of-sync it will also only be in English.  This the only reason that someone, with computer and network access, might not be able to participate, i.e. if someone can't code in English, there will be a limit to how much they can participate.

Despite code and documentation being limited to English, mobs _may_ absolutely be held in other languages, if so, it needs to be mentioned in the scheduled session post or agreed to by all participants at the beginning of the session.


## Trait-based Differences

Be respectful of all other participants regardless of their culture, race, religion, gender identity, and relationship status.


## Traditional Accessibility

Includes individuals with visual, auditory, cognitive, or dexterity related challenges.

If a session isn't specifically targeted as supporting a specific challenge, then reasonable efforts should be made to accommodate all participants.  Examples of such accommodations include, but are not limited to, increasing an IDE's font-size or theme, enabling a visible speech-to-text transcript, understanding of alternative or slow driver performance.

Sessions must be open to anyone but the _may_ be targeted toward individuals with categorical or specific accessible challenges (e.g. for anyone who is visually challenged vs a session particularly for anyone with macular degeneration).
