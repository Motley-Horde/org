# Mob Roles

## Overview & fundamental roles

- Ideally a mob is 4 - 6 people.  
- A mob may not have more than 8 _active participants_, but can have an unlimited number of observers.  

Anyone involved will have at least one role, but can have multiple roles.

Everyone is either an active participant or an observer.  Active participants rotate through the Driver role, and when applicable, the Moderator, roles throughout the mob session.

All active participants have one, and only one, of the following roles, which rotate during each session:
  - driver (required)
  - mobber (up to 7)
  - mediator (if there are more than 8 individuals, the mediator role monitors any dialog among the observers and communicate relevant information with the other active participants, i.e. mobbers)


## Primary Role Descriptions

### Driver

The Driver is the only person actually typing and is only does so for the time period specified in the [mob process](mob-process.md).  Think of the Driver as the computer on Star Trek ships â€”they simply follow instructions that are given by the Mobbers.

### Mobbers

Mobbers discuss and decide on the next steps to be taken.  When there is consensus the Driver implements the resulting decision.  

### Moderator

To enable as many people to participate in some way for any mob session, while still keeping the actual mob a reasonable size, if there are more than the maximum number of active participants, everyone else is an observer.  To enable these observers to still maintain some degree of an active role, one of the active participants fills the role of Moderator, monitoring the observer conversations and passing relevant questions, observations, etc. to the other Mobbers.  Like the Driver, the Moderator only fills the roll so for the time period specified in the [mob process](mob-process.md).


## Secondary Role Descriptions

Since one of the goals is to improve mobbing skills, there will likely be additional possible roles (e.g. [roles in mob rpg](https://github.com/willemlarsen/mobprogrammingrpg/blob/master/rpg_roles_plain_text.md)).
