# Mob Process

The technological aspects of this need to be determined and validated.


## Scheduling

People can schedule mob sessions for 1 hour increments and should indicate what project or training activity they're working on, the relevant skillsets, technology to use for the actual mobbing session, and anything else of relevance to the specific session, for example prerequisite machine set-up and configuration.  

For mob sessions working on projects there should, ideally, be at least one person who is moderately proficient in each identified skillset.


## Session

Participants for that session:
- determine an order for filling the Driver role, and if appropriate, the Moderator role.
- determine whether they want to rotate every 10 minutes, or a fraction of the hour that will result in each participant roughly comparable periods.  
  Recommendations:  
  - 2, 3, or 6 people - rotate every 10 minutes
  - 4 people - rotate every 14 minutes
  - 5 people - rotate every 11 minutes
- if a project or activity wasn't specifically included in the session schedule, determine which project or activity to work on.

Based on the ordering, participants rotate through the driver and moderator roles.
