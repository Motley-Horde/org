# Motley Horde of Technoids

## Introduction

The Motley Horde of Technoids has been created as an *extremely open, mob-driven, development organization*.  

At present, _any and all_ aspects of this organization are up for discussion and modification.


## Required Information

To be an active participant in a mob, you must be familiar with the information on this page and the pages listed in this "Required Information" section.  Please note that the linked pages, may include links to additional or more detailed information, but you only ***need*** to be familiar with the information on these specific pages in order to participate.  

  - [Goals](docs/primer/goals.md)  
  - [Vision](docs/primer/vision.md)  
  - [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging](docs/primer/heterogeneity.md)  
  - [Our Mob Process](docs/references/mob-process.md)  
  - [Our Mob Roles](docs/references/mob-roles.md)  


## Contributions

For all tasks, and particularly the documentation tasks, ensure that the results meet all aspects of our organizational [accessibility](docs/primer/heterogeneity.md) criteria.  
  
There are many aspects of coding projects, and organizations in general, that don't directly generate or modify code.  These aspects may be worked on as a mob or individually. Such tasks should include the label "[solo suitable](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AMotley-Horde+label%3A%22solo-suitable%22&type=Issues)".  


## Open & Transparent

To the extent possible, every aspect of this effort should be open, transparent, and community-driven. I chose a name, started this GitHub organization with this repo, and I have organized my visions, goals, reasons, etc for _starting_ such an effort *__solely__ to lay the groundwork and bootstrap all of it.*  Anything that can be done by the community should be done by the community.  In addition to the actual Mob sessions, this includes everything from deciding on an actual organizational name to expanding this documentation, and, most importantly, setting up mob sessions.  This idea, organization, and documentation is simply a seed, like all seeds, it needs the right environment and conditions to actually grow into its own.  

Code should only be worked on in mob sessions.  

Non-code tasks that can be done —in a way that includes the community— may be completed via discussions or community-approved pull requests.  Most of these tasks can still be completed via mob (e.g. [mobbing email](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayhbFAJm6Zs)).

Tasks which require community consensus, should be decided by votes [^farcical].  


## External Resources

Like all great efforts, this organization and its goals are built on the shoulders of giants and the efforts of many other people, past and present.  
  
To truly understand many of the goals and methods of this effort it is very useful to learn more about some pivotal predecessors, including (in no particular order):  
- Open Organizations' Structure, Policies, and Documentation:  
  - [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) [^hosting-irony]  
  - [Buffer](https://buffer.com/transparency)
- Global programming events and experiments
  - [In Praise of Tweaking: A Wiki-like Programming Contest](http://web.archive.org/web/20160314075417/http://starchamber.com/gulley/pubs/tweaking/tweaking.html)
  - [Global Day of CodeRetreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/?seed=9393)
  - [Global Liquid Mob](https://global-liquid-mob.github.io/)  



[^farcical]: Even if we end up with a few "Boaty McBoat Face"s.  

[^hosting-irony]: The irony of using GitHub as the primary hosting site is not lost on me.  I've done so solely because GitHub is an industry standard.  The repos should be mirrored to GitLab and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/), but any other hosting changes definitely need to be a community decision.
